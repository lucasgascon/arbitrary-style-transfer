# Real-time Arbitrary Style Transfer with Adaptive Instance Normalization

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time arbitrary style transfer using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) from the paper Xun Huang, & Serge Belongie. (2017). Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization. This project was developed as part of the Generative Modelling for Images class at MVA (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage) Master at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. The course was taught by Arthur Leclaire and Bruno Galerne.

## Introduction
Arbitrary style transfer aims to apply the artistic style of one image (the style image) to another image (the content image) while preserving the content of the latter. This project explores real-time style transfer.

## Methodology
The core technique used in this project is Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). AdaIN aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features, effectively transferring the style to the content image. We implemented this technique using PyTorch, leveraging its capabilities for efficient computation on GPUs.
